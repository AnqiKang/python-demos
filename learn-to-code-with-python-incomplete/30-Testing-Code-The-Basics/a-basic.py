The goal of testing is writing code that validates the funcationality of other code.

Tests prevent regression. A regression is when a feature that used to work no longer does. 

A test suite is a collection of tests that target related functionality.

Code converage or test converage refers to the percentage of the codebase that is tested by tests.
